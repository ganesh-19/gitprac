1) "SLICE_COMPOSITE:"
	
	There are two terms i.e. Slice and Composite Literal. Slice is a composite data type similar to an array 
	which is used to hold the elements of the same data type. 
	The main difference between array and slice is that slice can vary in size dynamically but not an array.
	Composite literals are used to construct the values for arrays, structs, slices, and maps. Each time they 
	are evaluated, it will create new value. They consist of the type of the literal followed by a brace-bound 
	list of elements. 

2) "EXAMPLE:"

	
		runs_1 := []int{10,20,30,40, 50, 60}

			-> {10,20,30,40, 50, 60} -- composite literal of int type 

			-> := short declaration operator

			-> runs_1 = name of slice 

			-> []int = slice of int type
